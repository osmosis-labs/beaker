[Beaker](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/beaker) makes it easy to scaffold a new cosmwasm app, with all of the dependencies for osmosis hooked up, interactive console, and a sample front-end at the ready.

## Getting Started

This section is intended to give you an introduction to `Beaker`, for more detailed reference, you can find them [here](./docs/commands/README.md).

### Installation

Beaker is available via [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) which is a rust toolchain. Once cargo is ready on your machine, run:

```sh
cargo install beaker
```

Now `beaker` is ready to use!

### Scaffolding your new dapp project

In the directory you want your project to reside, run:

```sh
beaker new counter-dapp
```

This will generate new directory called `counter-dapp` which, by default, come from [this template](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/beaker/tree/main/templates/project).

So what's in the template? Let's have a look...

```
.
├── frontend
├── contracts
├── Cargo.toml
├── Beaker.toml
├── .gitignore
└── .beaker
```

#### `frontend` and `contracts`

These should be self explanatory, it's where frontend and contracts are stored. And as you might be able to guess from the name, one project can contain multiple contracts.

#### `Cargo.toml`

There is a `Cargo.toml` here which specifies [cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).

```
[workspace]

members = [
  'contracts/*',
]

[profile.release]
...
```

All the crates (rust packages) in contracts directory are included, with unified release profile. With this, when we have to optimize multiple contracts deterministically, we can do that with ease (see [Contracts as Workspace Members section in rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer#contracts-as-workspace-members)).

#### `Beaker.toml`

This is our configuration file, you can find more information about it [here](./docs/config/README.md).

#### `.beaker`

Last but not least, `.beaker` which is the most unusal part. It contains 2 files:

```
├── state.json
└── state.local.json
```

These 2 files has similar functionality, which are containing beaker related state such as `address`, `code-id`, `label` for each contract on each network for later use.

While `state.json` is there for mainnet and testnet state. `state.local.json` is intended to use locally and _being gitignored_ since its state will not make any sense on other's machine.

And I don't think we have to explain about `.gitignore` don't we?

---

### Your first CosmWasm contract with Beaker

After that we can create new contract (the command uses template from [cw-template](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-template))

```sh
cd counter-dapp
beaker wasm new counter
```

Now your new contract will be avaiable on `contracts/counter`.

If you want to use other contract template, you can change the configuration, for example:

```
# Beaker.toml

[wasm]
template_repo = "https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cw-tpl-osmosis.git"
```

### Deploy contract on LocalOsmosis

LocalOsmosis, as it's name suggest, is Osmosis for local development. In the upcoming release, Beaker will have more complete integration with LocalOsmosis, it has to be installed and run separately.

You can install from source by following the instruction at [osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis), or use the official installer and select option 3:

```sh
curl -sL https://get.osmosis.zone/install > i.py && python3 i.py
```

After that, `counter` contract can be deployed (build + store-code + instantiate) using the following command:

```sh
beaker wasm deploy counter --signer-account test1 --no-wasm-opt --raw '{ "count": 0 }'
```

What's happending here equivalent to the following command sequence:

```sh
# build .wasm file
# stored in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<CONTRACT_NAME>.wasm`
# `--no-wasm-opt` is suitable for development, explained below
beaker wasm build --no-wasm-opt

# read .wasm in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<CONTRACT_NAME>.wasm` due to `--no-wasm-opt` flag
# use `--signer-account test1` which is predefined.
# The list of all predefined accounts are here: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis#accounts
# `code-id` is stored in the beaker state, local by default
beaker wasm store-code counter --signer-account test1 --no-wasm-opt

# instantiate counter contract
# with instantiate msg: '{ "count": 0 }'
beaker wasm instanitate counter --signer-account test1 --raw '{ "count": 0 }'
```

The flag `--no-wasm-opt` is skipping [rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) for faster development iteration.

For testnet/mainnet deployment, use:

```sh
beaker wasm deploy counter --signer-account <ACCOUNT> --raw '{ "count": 0 }' --network testnet
beaker wasm deploy counter --signer-account <ACCOUNT> --raw '{ "count": 0 }' --network mainnet
```

Instantiate message can be stored for later use:

```sh
mkdir contracts/counter/instantiate-msgs
echo '{ "count": 0 }' > contracts/counter/instantiate-msgs/default.json
beaker wasm deploy counter --signer-account test1 --no-wasm-opt
```

You can find references for [`beaker wasm` subcommand here](./docs/commands/beaker_wasm.md).

### Console

After deployed, you can play with the deployed contract using:

```sh
beaker console
```

This will launch custom node repl, where `contract`, `account` are available.
`contract` contains deployed contract.
`account` contains [pre-defined accounts in localosmosis](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis#accounts).

So you can interact with the recently deployed contract like this:

```js
await contract.counter.execute({ increment: {} }).by(account.test1);
await contract.counter.query({ get_count: {} });
```

You can find avaialable methods for the aforementioned instances here:

- [Account](./ts/beaker-console/docs/classes//Account.md#methods-1)
- [Contract](./ts/beaker-console/docs/classes//Contract.md#methods-1)

You can remove `contract` and/or `account` namespace by changing config.

```
# Beaker.toml

[console]
account_namespace = false
contract_namespace = false
```

```js
await counter.execute({ increment: {} }).by(test1);
await counter.query({ get_count: {} });
```

Beaker console is also allowed to deploy contract, so that you don't another terminal tab to do so.

```js
.deploy counter -- --signer-account test1 --raw '{ "count": 999 }'
```

`.build`, `.storeCode`, `.instantiate` commands are also available and has the same options as Beaker cli command, except that `--no-wasm-opt` are in by default since it is being intended to use in the development phase.

`.help` to see all avaiable commands.

Apart from that, in the console, you can access Beaker's state and configuration from `state` and `conf` variables accordingly.

### Frontend

Beaker project template also come with frontend template.

```sh
cd frontend
yarn && yarn dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser.

To interact, you need to [add LocalOsmosis to keplr](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/LocalOsmosis/tree/main/localKeplr).

In frontend directory, you will see that `.beaker` is in here. It is actually symlinked to the one in the root so that frontend code can access beaker state.

### Customization

If you would like to use another contract template, feel free to change the configuration

```toml
# In Beaker.toml, change the template_repo to whatever you want.
[wasm]
template_repo = "https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-bindings.git"
```
